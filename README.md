# Thib - Object Fitter
A small Unity utility to assist in fitting objects meshes perfectly between other object meshes, along equal axis.

## NOTE
Keep in mind that this only aligns along equal axis and ignores rotation.
- Object X centers/scales along the X axis of the X bounds objects
- Object Y centers/scales along the Y axis of the Y bounds objects
- Object Z centers/scales along the Z axis of the Z bounds objects

If you want to apply rotation you should do this afterwards. I might implement rotation support at a later point in time, we'll see. :)
